        <h1 class="para">Rayvon Mathiu</h1>
        <h3 class="para">And I'm a <span>Frontend Developer</span></h3>
        <p class="para"> Rayvon is a rising star in the field of computer science, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Technology. Born and raised in the bustling city of Metropolis,<br/> my fascination with technology began at a young age when he would tinker with his family's old desktop computer, learning to code simple programs and exploring the endless possibilities of the digital world.

            As i progressed through my academic journey, my passion for computer science only grew stronger. Excelling in his math and science courses, he quickly realized that the intersection of these disciplines,<br/> combined with his innate problem-solving abilities, made him well-suited for a career in the tech industry.
            
            Throughout my time at the University of Technology, i have consistently demonstrated his academic prowess, maintaining a GPA of 3.8 out of 4.0.<br/> My course load has been a rigorous one, encompassing a wide range of computer science subjects, including data structures, algorithms, database management, and software engineering. My ability to excel in these challenging courses has earned him the respect of his professors and peers alike.
            
            Beyond the classroom, i have been actively involved in the university's Robotics Club, where he has collaborated with a team of dedicated students to design, build, and program autonomous robots for various competitions. My technical expertise, coupled with his strong leadership skills,<br/> have been instrumental in the club's success, and he was recently elected as the club's vice president.
            
            In addition to my academic and extracurricular pursuits, i also had the opportunity to apply his skills in a professional setting.<br/> During a recent summer internship at ABC Corporation, a leading technology company, i demonstrated my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail while assisting the IT support team with hardware maintenance, software installations, and user troubleshooting.
            
            My passion for technology extends far beyond his academic and professional endeavors. I am regular participant in local hackathons and coding competitions, constantly seeking opportunities to challenge himself and expand his knowledge.<br/> My drive and determination has earned me recognition from the university, as i have been consistently named to the Dean's List throughout his academic career.
            
            As i approaches the final year of his undergraduate studies, i poised to make a significant impact in the field of computer science. With his exceptional academic performance, hands-on experience, and unwavering dedication, Michael is well-equipped to excel in his future endeavors, whether it be pursuing a graduate degree,<br/> securing a coveted position in the tech industry, or using his skills to contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.</p>
